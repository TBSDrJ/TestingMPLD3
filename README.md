# TestingMPLD3

I am trying out the python package mpld3: [MPLD3 Quick Start Guide](https://mpld3.github.io/quickstart.html).

I am hoping to be able to export matplotlib graphs into HTML, trying to help out student [Nicholas Liu](https://github.com/liunicholas).

I did not have any success with this.  The pip install in python 3.7 came through with no public functions; when I run `dir(mpld3)` in a python shell, I get: `['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__path__', '__spec__']` which does not include any of the useful functions.
